{"name":"Openradio","tagline":"Catalogue of radio statios broadcasting in open formats","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nIt should be easy for anyone to set up an Internet radio station and it should be easy for anyone to listen to it.\r\nThis site attempts to promote this principle by providing a directory of stations streaming using open codecs.\r\nWell known codecs include MP3 and WMA. These are [proprietary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_format),\r\nwith restrictions on use and modification.\r\n\r\nOpen codecs do not require licensing and may be improved upon by anyone with relevant skills. This benefits\r\ndevelopers, who can pass improvements in audio quality and software on to the broadcaster and listener.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nRadio has, for years, been constrained by licensing of the airwaves. [On the Internet](http://www.kurthanson.com/),\r\nthere's no need for such restrictions, but radio is still facing attacks from many fronts. The most onerous of these\r\nis the [licence fees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Royalty_Board) levied by the 'industry bodies' in the\r\nUS. Other threats include the proprietary nature of some technology involved in production, transmission and reception.\r\n\r\n### Codecs\r\n\r\nThe amount of raw audio data stored a compact disc is large enough that most people's Internet connections are\r\ntoo slow to allow streaming the music to them in 'real time'. For downloading audio to listen to later, this\r\nisn't such a problem, but for radio, people want to be able to listen 'live'. Audio compression allows this to happen.\r\n\r\nThe audio codec which everyone has heard of is MP3. It is a proprietary, patented, codec. Anyone who makes a\r\nprogram or device which plays or records MP3 is required to pay licence fees. These fees can be prohibitively\r\nexpensive for developers - especially those who do not profit from the software they produce. Those who develop\r\nfree software are still liable to pay licence fees.\r\n\r\nMost players support MP3 simply because it's the most popular format: people expect to be able to play MP3s.\r\nThe popularity of the format, however, has nothing to do with its technical strengths and seems to be mainly\r\ndue to the laziness and lack of intelligence of the media.\r\n\r\nThere are many audio codecs, but MP3 was the first word on the lips of various reporters and others didn't\r\nbother to investigate other formats, or, because they didn't really understand was MP3 was, didn't even consider\r\nthat there could be alternatives. If they did look into alternatives, they didn't understand enough to talk about\r\nthem with confidence, so they took the easy route, even referring to competing formats as 'MP3', ostensibly to\r\navoid confusing the public, but in reality to avoid confusing the reporters.\r\n\r\nThe alternative audio codecs are not as alternative as you might expect. Apple's iPod, in addition (and in\r\npreference) to MP3, supports AAC, which is technically (and practically) vastly superior to MP3. Apple encourage\r\nusers to choose AAC by making it the default codec used by iTunes. When you buy a track from the iTunes store,\r\nyou get AAC. When you 'rip' tunes from a CD to listen to in iTunes or on your iPod, iTunes encodes them in AAC.\r\n\r\nThe technical differences between audio codecs are [many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_data_compression).\r\nThis site, however, is most concerned with the openness of formats, so will leave the interested reader to investigate.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nThis site considers an audio codec open if it is relatively free from restrictions on its use. Requirement to\r\nobtain a licence to use the codec is not acceptable, especially if a licence fee is charged. Attempts to require\r\nlicensing of alternative implementations or competitive formats using similar ideas are also unacceptable.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only codec which is widely used for audio streams and meets the requirements is\r\n[Vorbis](http://vorbis.com/). This site, therefore, links only to Ogg Vorbis streams. It may be of interest\r\nthat [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/) currently uses Ogg Vorbis for all sound recordings, for reasons similar\r\nto those given on this site.\r\n","google":"UA-152426-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
